# Candidate Assessment Tool

This project is an attempt to make an application with "real-time" feedback for
interviewers during an interview while also coordinating the questions to ask
during the interview and, maybe eventually, who should ask them. The goal being
to make the interviewing experience more consistent and repeatable without the
need for "expert" interviewers. The tool will also accept feedback from each
interviewer to help make a more "object" decision after the interview is complete.
